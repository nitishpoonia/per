          MFU A. MoM of the group. You're very responsible, organized, and reserved, and you always try to make sure that everyone is safe and having a good time.
          Even though your friends may tease you for a little bit, they still love and appreciate your rational mind and your ability to be there for them no matter what.
          However, your desire to be in control of everything can be a serious issue for your friends. Sometimes they just want to have fun with you, but your well-ordered nature doesn't let you do that.
          Try to give yourself a break once in a while- the world Definitely won't collapse if you let loose from time to time.
B. Cool rebel
You’re independent, opinionated, confident and full of fun and exciting stories to tell. You are usually the one to organize pranks or propose crazy schemes to your group. At the same time, you are quite impulsive and emotional, which can lead to conflict and misunderstanding among you and ur friends. Still, you are always pushing them to be unapologetically themselves and bring even more fun and spontaneity into their lives, and they endlessly value your friendship for that. Another possible problem, though, is that it’s often sensitive topics and really open your heart to somebody since you’re so used to maintaining a cool and unbothered facade. Don’t forget that we all are struggling with something and being vulnerable doesn’t make you weak!

C. Peacemaker
You are a very genuine, sincere, and kind person who’s always ready to give a helping hand to anyone who needs it. You are the friend everybody seeks comfort and advice from because you are a good listener and a really wise person. These qualities also help you keep your group from breaking apart whenever suddenly starts to fight. Your friends are very lucky to have someone like you in their lives. But your kind-hearted and caring nature has its downsides too, and the main one is that you often forget to dedicate time to yourself. You are so willing to solve everybody’s problems that you barely have time to figure out your own life. Make it a rule to detox your life and take out some time for yourself. After all, it’s you that should be your main priority, not somebody else.
D. Fun clown
You are usually the one who always throws sarcastic and hilarious comments to make everybody around you cry with laughter. You like to kindly tease your friends and make fun of them but you never cross the line, so they know that it’s all for a good laugh. But your impeccable sense of humor isn’t your only weapon. You’re very sweet and protective and you have a huge heart. But it can very hard for you to talk about something personal and reveal your true feelings. You always try to crack a joke to avoid serious conservations, and as a result, you bottle up a lot of your emotions. Try to take small steps towards being open to your buddies and show. Them your sensitive side.
E. Baby
You are very sweet and innocent, and you have a very vivid imagination that allows you to come up with the most creative solutions. You have tons of hobbies and you are passionate about pretty much all of them. And your ability to think outside of the box make you an even better creator. Your friends usually get inspired after spending time with you and go home with tons of amazing ideas of their own- and the confidence that everything is possible. But despite all that, you can be very impartial and clueless at times since you spend most of your time in your dreams, forgetting about the real world. Do your best to find a perfect balance between living in the moment and having your heads in the clouds, and your life will become even more colorful and interesting.
